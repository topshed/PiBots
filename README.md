##Rise of the Robots
### A CodeClub:Raspberry Pi Project

This repo contains the worksheets, example code and STL files that I've put together for the robotics project I'm running at [Cranmere Primary school](http://www.cranmereprimary.org.uk/) [Codeclub](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/).  

You can find a [BOM for the various components here](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/bom-for-sub-15-raspberry-pi-robot.html).

The STL files for 3D printing your own chassis are also included although you can make your own cassis out of cardboard, balsa wood on any material to which you can screw (or stick) the motor brackets.
