This repo contains the worksheets, example code and STL files that I've put together for the robotics project I'm running at [Cranmere Primary school](http://www.cranmereprimary.org.uk/) [Codeclub](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/).  


Currently finished worksheets:

1) Introduction
2) Single motor
3) Two motors
4) ultrasonic eyes

You can find a [BOM for the various components here](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/bom-for-sub-15-raspberry-pi-robot.html).

The STL files for 3D printing your own chassis are also included although you can make your own cassis out of cardboard, balsa wood on any material to which you can screw (or stick) the motor brackets.

I will update this with additional worksheets and code as they are created.

Coming soon: Adding a controller.
